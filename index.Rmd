# Introduction

PFAS- per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances are one of the most concerned contaminants. According to EPA, PFAS are widely used long lasting chemicals with a slower decay rate. PFAS were developed in around 1940 to use them in everyday products including cookware’s, clothes etc. It has been an excellent invention till we had no idea of its effects on human health. Dupont patented Teflon for the industrial use in 1946, which contained thousands of PFAS. Awareness against this chemical started to grow during late 1990’s when a lawyer sued the Dupont for dumping over thousands of tons chemical in West Virginia near a farmland. The lawsuit continued for more than 20 years and they settled it for a large amount of money. This lawsuit has brought upon the detrimental facts of PFAS. In USA almost 90% people are already carrying PFAS in their blood, which is an alarming factor.

# Materials and methods

PFAS acts like a slow poison. Due to the persistence of these chemicals, long term existence in human cells is possible. Still people are not aware of this.  In this study I will use US MAP data and PFAS contamination dataset from EPA. I will use Rstudio to write the code.

Code: The code associated with the project is well organized and easy to follow. Demonstrates mastery of R graphics and functions.

Data: [Datasource](https://echo.epa.gov/system/files/Drinking_Water_Testing_Data_State_01-03-2022_0.xlsx)

A number of states and individual public water systems have been testing source water and finished water for PFAS, but these records are not maintained by EPA in a national repository. EPA has provided states that are regulating and/or testing PFAS with a mechanism to store/report PFAS data that is associated with state-specific PFAS regulations.

## Methodology

Here are few packages enlisted which I am planning to use to plot the map. Such as I will use dplyr for joining data sets, leaflet for the base map. 

library(tidyverse)  Im not sure you need to list this library twice.

library(ggplot2)

library(dplyr)

library(stringr)



## Expected results
To represent a graphical variation of contamination and their effects in different states of the US.

## CODE

Loaded required packages in a code chunk (All packages are subjected to prior installation):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse) 
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

## Data Preparation
```{r}
us_states <- map_data("state")
us_counties <- map_data("county")
head(us_states)


project_data <- "E:/GEO511/final_project-ehsanulhtan/Data/Drinking_Water_Testing_Data_PFAS Map.csv" Code is based on specific file path maybe edit to make it mroe general use? 
csv_data <- read.csv(project_data) 
csv_data [c("county","abbr")] <- str_split_fixed(csv_data$County, ",", 2)
csv_data$county <- tolower(csv_data$county)


pfas_county <- csv_data %>% 
  filter(Concentration >=0) %>%
  group_by(county) %>%
  summarize(pfas_min= min(Concentration,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(pfas_min != "ND")
```

# Results

This map represents minimum contamination level found in public water systems situated in counties. Grey zones represents places where data was noot available for PFAs. It doesn't ensure that grey zone is safe from PFAS. 

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="PFAS Contamination in Counties USA"}
us_counties %>% 
  left_join(pfas_county, by=c("subregion"="county")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group, fill=pfas_min)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "grey90", size = 0.1) +
  coord_map(projection = "albers", lat0 = 45, lat1 = 55) +
  scale_fill_discrete(guide = "none")+
  theme(legend.position="bottom",
        axis.line=element_blank(),
        axis.text=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks=element_blank(),
        axis.title=element_blank(),
        panel.background=element_blank(),
        panel.border=element_blank(),
        panel.grid=element_blank())
```


# Conclusions

To understand the true risk factors of PFAS we have to make people aware about PFAS. This map would be the first step to make people aware about their neighborhood.
